> **Found this useful? [Star the repo](https://github.com/sergebulaev/linkedin-skills).** Curated Claude Code and Codex directories rank and gate by star count, so a star is what makes these skills findable for the next person. It is the only thing we ask. No signup, no email.

## What you can do

Once installed, just ask Claude Code or Codex for help with LinkedIn. The right skill activates automatically.

**Write a post:**
> "Write me a LinkedIn post about why AI agencies are replacing traditional ones. Make it viral."

**Comment on someone's post:**
> "Comment on this post: https://linkedin.com/posts/... — I want to add a thoughtful take."

**Check a draft before publishing:**
> "Audit this post draft for AI tells and algorithm issues: [paste your text]"

**Reverse-engineer a viral post:**
> "What hook formula does this post use? https://linkedin.com/posts/..."

**Plan your week:**
> "Create a 7-day LinkedIn content plan. I'm a B2B SaaS founder targeting VPs of Marketing."

**Rewrite your profile:**
> "Optimize my LinkedIn profile for inbound leads: https://linkedin.com/in/yourname"

**Remove AI tells from any text:**
> "Humanize this text: [paste AI-generated draft]"

Every skill shows you a draft first and waits for your OK before doing anything. Nothing gets posted without your approval.

## The 11 skills

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Post Writer** | Drafts viral-ready posts using 20 proven 2026 hook formulas (anaphora, R.I.P. obituary, year-over-year pivot, curiosity gap, emotional cold-open, controlled A/B, false-binary, and 13 more) plus a founders-edition angle library, picked by engagement goal |
| **Comment Drafter** | Drafts a comment on any LinkedIn post from its URL |
| **Reply Handler** | Drafts a reply to any comment, correctly handling LinkedIn's 2-level thread flattening |
| **Post Audit** | Checks your draft against 2026 algorithm rules and AI-detection patterns before you publish |
| **Humanizer** | Removes the AI tells human readers and LinkedIn's slop filter react to: 2026 AI vocabulary scored by paragraph density, reveal bridges, staccato fragment stacks, stacked triads, performed sincerity; caps em dashes instead of banning them. Does not promise to beat detectors (no edit reliably does). Bundles three sub-tools: AI-emoji density scorer, multi-detector spread tester (GPTZero, Originality.ai, ZeroGPT, Sapling, Copyleaks) that documents how much they disagree, and a rule-explainer reference for defending stylistic choices. |
| **Hook Extractor** | Reverse-engineers the hook formula from any viral post. Returns a blank template you can fill with your own topic |
| **Content Planner** | Creates a 7-day plan with daily post topics, formats, hooks, posting times, and comment targets |
| **Engagement Monitor** | Two read-side workflows: (1) tracks your comment threads for author replies and drafts follow-ups in the 6-24h window; (2) pulls likers and commenters on any post and groups them by ICP fit (peer / aspirational / prospect). |
| **Profile Optimizer** | Rewrites your headline, About section, Featured section, and Experience for 2026 conversion patterns |
| **Employee Advocacy** | Plans a team LinkedIn program: 14-day launch, posting cadence, brand governance, ROI tracking |
| **Repurposer** | Turns content from another platform (tweet, thread, YouTube video, blog, newsletter) into a native LinkedIn post: re-hooks for the fold, expands to the 900-1300 char sweet spot, moves links to the first comment, runs the humanizer |

## Built for founders

If you are a founder, the bundle ships a dedicated founder layer. Your real constraint is rarely reach. It is a small number of high-stakes readers: the next investor, the next hire, the design partner who becomes a case study. The founder layer optimizes for trust with that narrow audience instead of impressions.

- **10 founder angles** (`references/founder-topics.md`) as fill-in templates: reprice the category, content-to-pipeline, audience of one, the scarce-shots math, the unglamorous bet, the limit of delegation, designed serendipity, the evasive-sentence test, the delegation line, the learning gate. Each maps to an engagement goal and a hook formula.
- **4 structural hook formulas (F17-F20)** that shape a post's logic: controlled A/B anecdote, false-binary dissolve, anecdote-meets-evidence bridge, diverging-curves close.
- **A founders-edition content plan** (Conviction / Building in public / The math / Proof) in the Content Planner.

Just tell the Post Writer you are a founder, or ask the Content Planner for a "founder plan," and the skills reach for these first.

## Optional: read LinkedIn data with Apify

Four of the skills (Comment Drafter, Reply Handler, Hook Extractor, Engagement Monitor) can read post bodies, comment threads, your own recent comments, and the people who liked or commented on any post. Without an Apify token they fall back to asking you to paste the relevant text. With one, they fetch automatically.

[Apify](https://console.apify.com/sign-up) free tier ships with $5/month of credit, which goes a long way at $1-$5 per 1,000 results. The skills use four no-cookies actors:

| Use case | Actor | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Post body by URL | `supreme_coder/linkedin-post` | $1 / 1,000 |
| Comments + replies on a post | `apimaestro/linkedin-post-comments-replies-engagements-scraper-no-cookies` | $5 / 1,000 |
| Your own recent comments | `apimaestro/linkedin-profile-comments` | $5 / 1,000 |
| Likers + commenters on any post | `scraping_solutions/linkedin-posts-engagers-likers-and-commenters-no-cookies` | $5 / 1,000 |

Setup: drop `APIFY_TOKEN=apify_api_...` into your `.env`. The thin client at `lib/apify_client.py` exposes `fetch_post`, `fetch_post_comments`, `fetch_user_recent_comments`, and `fetch_post_engagers`.

A typical creator running daily comment ops + a weekly engager-analytics sweep stays under $2/month, well inside the free tier.

## Optional: auto-post with Publora

By default, skills draft content for you to copy-paste into LinkedIn. If you want Claude Code or Codex to publish directly to your LinkedIn (and optionally to X, Threads, Instagram), connect Publora. It takes about 2 minutes.

### What is Publora?

[Publora](https://publora.com) is a publishing API that handles LinkedIn's quirks (3 different URL formats, reaction type mismatches, thread flattening bugs). The free tier gives you 15 posts/month.

### Setup (2 minutes)

**Step 1.** Sign up at https://app.publora.com/signup (free)

**Step 2.** Connect LinkedIn: click **Channels** in the left sidebar, then **Add Channel**, pick **LinkedIn**, authorize.

**Step 3.** Find your Platform ID: go to **Channels**, click your LinkedIn account. The ID looks like `linkedin-ABC123DEF`. Copy the whole thing including `linkedin-`.

**Step 4.** Get your API key: click **Settings** (gear icon, bottom-left), then **API**, then **Create Key**. Copy the `sk_...` string.

**Step 5.** Create a file called `.env` in the linkedin-skills folder:

```
PUBLORA_API_KEY=sk_paste_your_key_here
LINKEDIN_PLATFORM_ID=linkedin-paste_your_id_here
```

If you cloned the repo, you can copy the template instead:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then open `.env` and replace the placeholders with your real values.

**Step 6.** Install two small Python packages:

```bash
pip install requests python-dotenv
```

**Step 7.** Test it. Ask Claude Code or Codex:

> "Schedule a test LinkedIn post via Publora 24 hours from now: 'testing the API connection — will cancel in dashboard'."

If Publora returns a scheduled-post ID, you're set. Cancel the post in the Publora dashboard before the scheduled time. If you get HTTP 401, your API key is wrong. If you get HTTP 400 about a missing platformId, your `LINKEDIN_PLATFORM_ID` isn't set. See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## Optional: generate illustrations with Pixfaro

Posts with a visual get more dwell time. The Post Writer can generate an illustration for a draft (a feed image, a carousel slide, or a quote-card of your hook) and attach it automatically when publishing. Without a key it drafts the image prompt and asks you to generate it yourself, so nothing breaks.

[Pixfaro](https://pixfaro.com) is a single image API over multiple models (from `flux-schnell` at $0.004 to `gpt-5-image`). It composites your handle, brand color, or logo onto the image as a **pixel-exact overlay**, so a cheap base model still renders crisp text on a quote-card or thumbnail. Pull those brand fields from your [Voice & Brand Profile](references/voice-profile.md) (section 6) and every asset stays on-brand.

Setup: drop `PIXFARO_TOKEN=pf_live_...` into your `.env`. The thin client at `lib/pixfaro_client.py` and the wrappers `lib.illustrate(prompt, kind=...)` / `lib.refine(image_id, instruction)` return a hosted URL that flows straight into `lib.publish(..., media_urls=[url])`. `refine` edits a prior image by its id (cheaper than regenerating); results carry `cost`, `balance_after`, and a `premium` flag so the skills never quietly spend on a pricey model.

## Voice rules

Every skill follows these rules automatically:

1. Em dashes capped at about 1 per 100 words. The character stopped being a tell in 2026; the density is.
2. Capitalize names. Always. Lowercase reads as disrespectful.
3. No AI vocabulary: "leverage", "fundamentally", "streamline", "harness", "delve", "unlock", "foster".
4. Specific numbers beat adjectives. "$14,200" beats "significant savings".
5. One sharp insight per comment beats three vague ones.
6. 200-350 chars for comments, 900-1,300 chars for posts.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| Skills don't activate when I ask about LinkedIn | Make sure you installed via the Skills panel, `/plugin install`, or `codex plugin add`. Try starting a new conversation. |
| "Publora API key not provided" | Your `.env` file is missing or in the wrong folder. It should be in the `linkedin-skills/` root. |
| "401 Unauthorized" from Publora | Your API key expired. Go to Publora Settings > API > Create a new key. |
| "404 on comment/post" | Your `LINKEDIN_PLATFORM_ID` is wrong. Go to Publora Channels and copy the full `linkedin-...` string. |
| "400 reactionType" error | Known Publora quirk. The skills handle this automatically. If you're calling the API manually, use PRAISE (not CELEBRATE), INTEREST (not INSIGHTFUL). |
| `pip install` fails | Use a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install requests python-dotenv` |

### OpenClaw quickstart

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sergebulaev/linkedin-skills.git

# Add to OpenClaw system prompt:
# "You have LinkedIn marketing skills in ./linkedin-skills/.
#  Read the relevant skills/*/SKILL.md before any LinkedIn task.
#  Use lib/url_parser.py for URL parsing,
#      lib/apify_client.py for reading posts / comments / engagers,
#      lib/publora_client.py for publishing."
```

### Generic Python agent quickstart

```python
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, "path/to/linkedin-skills")
from lib import parse_linkedin_url, PubloraClient, ApifyClient

parsed = parse_linkedin_url("https://www.linkedin.com/posts/slug-activity-7448808898326654978-iW20")
print(parsed["post_urn"])  # urn:li:activity:7448808898326654978

# Read side (Apify)
apify = ApifyClient()  # reads APIFY_TOKEN from env
post = apify.fetch_post(post_url="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/...")
engagers = apify.fetch_post_engagers(post_url="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/...", max_items=50)

# Write side (Publora)
client = PubloraClient()  # reads PUBLORA_API_KEY from env
client.create_comment(post_urn=parsed["post_urn"], message="draft", platform_id="linkedin-xxx")

# Image side (Pixfaro) — optional, reads PIXFARO_TOKEN from env
from lib import illustrate
img = illustrate("Minimal flat-vector lighthouse, calm blue palette", kind="wide")
# img["url"] -> pass to publish(..., media_urls=[img["url"]])
```

## URL handling

LinkedIn has three post URN types. The `lib/url_parser.py` handles all of them:

| URL fragment | URN |
|---|---|
| `/posts/slug-activity-7448...` | `urn:li:activity:7448...` |
| `/posts/slug-share-7449...` | `urn:li:share:7449...` |
| `/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7447...` | `urn:li:ugcPost:7447...` |

Comment URLs include a `commentUrn` query param. The parser extracts both `post_urn` and `comment_id`.

## Thread flattening

LinkedIn flattens reply threads to 2 levels. When replying to a reply, `parentComment` must point to the top-level comment URN, not the reply's URN. The `linkedin-reply-handler` skill handles this correctly.

## Testing the parser

```bash
python lib/url_parser.py "https://www.linkedin.com/posts/<author-handle>_activity-<id>"
```

## Who builds this

These skills come out of [Creative Content Crafts](https://cccrafts.ai), an engineering company. We build the machinery underneath a company's public voice: ICP parsing, engagement systems, content guardrails, and posting infrastructure. We do not sell the words themselves.

We call that layer **content engineering**. Writing collapsed to the price of a chat subscription. What stayed valuable is everything below it: pulling every post your market wrote this week, keeping a live list of the people who matter, engaging on it daily with judgment in the loop, and catching the risky drafts before the platform does.

On LinkedIn specifically, that is the whole job. We are engineers of LinkedIn growth, not a ghostwriting agency.

This repo is the thin top layer of that stack, open-sourced. The engine underneath is what we build for clients.
